# Generic Open Addressing Hash Table Library in C

The `Generic Open Addressing Hash Table Library` in C implements a high-performance hash table using linear probing for collision resolution. It efficiently stores and retrieves key-value pairs with minimal overhead, leveraging the `FNV-1a (Fowler-Noll-Vo)` hash algorithm to compute hash values. This data structure is particularly suited for applications requiring fast lookups, insertions, and deletions with a focus on simplicity and scalability.

| Index |     Key     |   Value   |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
|   0   |   "key1"    |  "value1" |
|   1   |   "key2"    |  "value2" |
|   2   |   "key3"    |  "value3" |
|   3   |   "key4"    |  "value4" |
|   4   |   "key5"    |  "value5" |

## Usage/Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "hashtable.h" // or <hashtable.h> if it's installed

int main(void) {
    // Initialize the hash table with an initial size of 10
    HashTable *hashTable = initHashTable(10);
    int year = 2024;

    // Insert key-value pairs into the hash table (animal names and habitats)
    hashTable->set(hashTable, "lion", "savannah");
    hashTable->set(hashTable, "tiger", "forest");
    hashTable->set(hashTable, "elephant", "grassland");
    hashTable->set(hashTable, "year", &year);
    hashTable->set(hashTable, "penguin", "antarctica");
    hashTable->set(hashTable, "kangaroo", "australian outback");

    // Retrieve and print the habitat for the "lion"
    printf("The lion lives in the: %s\n", hashTable->get(hashTable, "lion"));

    // Retrieve and print the current year
    printf("Current year: %d\n", *(int *)hashTable->get(hashTable, "year"));

    // Update the habitat of the "lion"
    hashTable->set(hashTable, "lion", "zoo");
    printf("The updated lion lives in the: %s\n", hashTable->get(hashTable, "lion"));

    // Check if "tiger" exists in the hash table
    if (hashTable->has(hashTable, "tiger"))
        puts("The tiger is in the hash table!");
    else
        puts("The tiger is not in the hash table.\n");

    // Delete the "penguin" entry from the hash table
    hashTable->delete(hashTable, "penguin");
    puts("Deleted the penguin entry.");

    // Check if "penguin" still exists after deletion
    if (hashTable->has(hashTable, "penguin"))
        puts("The penguin is still in the hash table!");
    else
        puts("The penguin has been deleted from the hash table.");

    // Print the size of the hash table (number of slots)
    printf("Size of hash table: %zu\n", hashTable->getSize(hashTable));

    // Print the count of elements currently in the hash table
    printf("Count of animals in hash table: %zu\n", hashTable->count(hashTable));

    // Free the memory allocated for the hash table
    hashTable->free(&hashTable);

    return 0;
}
```

### Performance and Efficiency

The Generic Open Addressing Hash Table is designed to offer high performance for common operations, including **insertion**, **deletion**, and **lookup**, while minimizing memory overhead. Its efficiency is mainly determined by the **hash function**, **collision resolution method**, and **dynamic resizing** mechanism. Below is a summary of how these factors contribute to the overall performance:

#### ‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity

- **Insertion**: O(1) on average. If the table is not full and there are no collisions, new elements are inserted in constant time. However, if a collision occurs, linear probing is used to resolve it, but the average time complexity remains O(1) due to the low load factor.
  
- **Lookup**: O(1) on average. The key-value pair can be retrieved in constant time if no collisions or minimal probing is needed. The hash function computes the index quickly, and if collisions occur, the linear probing allows for quick access to the correct entry.
  
- **Deletion**: O(1) on average. Deletion of an element is done in constant time, with linear probing employed to find the key. Once the key is found, it is removed, and the table is reorganized if necessary to maintain the integrity of the hash table.

- **Resizing**: O(n) during rehashing. When the load factor exceeds 0.7, the hash table is resized (doubled), and all elements are rehashed to their new positions. This operation takes O(n) time but happens infrequently (only when resizing occurs).

#### üßÆ Space Efficiency

The hash table is **space-efficient**, using a simple array of slots for storage. The only additional memory overhead comes from the storage of keys and values. The resizing process involves creating a new, larger array, but this helps ensure the table can scale efficiently as more elements are added.

#### üîÄ Handling Collisions

Collisions are resolved using **linear probing**, which ensures that all elements remain in contiguous slots. While this method is simple and effective, it may cause performance degradation as the table becomes more crowded. To maintain efficiency, the table automatically resizes when the load factor exceeds 0.7.

#### üîÑ Amortized Time Complexity

While some operations, like resizing and rehashing, may temporarily increase the cost of operations, these events happen infrequently. Over many operations, the average cost of insertion, deletion, and lookup remains constant, making the table highly efficient for long-term use.

#### üìà Scalability

The hash table is scalable, meaning it can efficiently grow as the number of stored elements increases. The resizing mechanism ensures that the hash table can handle large datasets without significant performance loss. 

By maintaining a low load factor and resizing dynamically, the hash table can handle a high number of elements while keeping operations efficient, even under heavy load.

#### üîë Generic Data Storage
The hash table is **generic**, allowing you to store any data type as values. Whether it's an **integer**, **float**, **struct**, or even **another hash table**, the hash table can handle it! The values are stored as `void *` pointers, meaning the hash table is flexible and can accommodate all kinds of data types.

**Strings are Immutable**: The keys in the hash table must be strings (const char *), and they should remain immutable. This ensures that the keys do not change during their lifetime, preventing issues during lookups or resizing. Modifying the strings after insertion may lead to undefined behavior.

**Store Any Data Type**: The values stored in the hash table can be any data type, provided that they are passed as pointers. Whether you‚Äôre storing simple types like integers or complex structures, the hash table can accommodate them all, making it a powerful tool for a wide range of applications.
